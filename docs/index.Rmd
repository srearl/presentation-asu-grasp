**reproducible research** "is the ability to recompute data analytic results, given an observed data set and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline."

Replicating studies remains the gold standard for rigorous scientific research, but reproducibility is increasingly viewed as a **minimum standard** that all scientists should strive toward.

**reproducibility for scientific reasons**

* increased trustworthiness
* more rigorous, reliable science
* learning more from one another's work

**reproducibility for personal reasons**

- helps researchers remember how and why they did *x*
- enables researches to quickly and simply modify figures, tables, etc.
- enables quick reconfiguration of previously conducted research tasks

basically, if the thought of redoing your analyses is terrifying then you are doing it wrong

# redoing analyses

class: middle

most basic principle for reproducible research is to **do everything via code**

* downloading data from the web 
* converting an Excel file to CSV
* renaming columns or variables 
* omitting bad samples or data points

*...do all of these programatically*
