**reproducible research** is the ability to recompute data analytic results, given an observed data set and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline.

Replicating studies remains the gold standard for rigorous scientific research, but reproducibility is increasingly viewed as a *minimum standard* that all scientists should strive toward.

**reproducibility for scientific reasons**

* increased trustworthiness
* more rigorous, reliable science
* learning more from one another's work

**reproducibility for personal reasons**

- helps researchers remember how and why they did *x*
- enables researchers to quickly and simply modify figures, tables, etc.
- enables quick reconfiguration of previously conducted research tasks

# how?

class: middle

most basic principle for reproducible research is to **do everything via code**

* downloading data from the web
* converting an Excel file to CSV
* renaming columns or variables
* omitting bad samples or data points

*...do all of these programatically*

**track your versions**  

Using version-control software such as Git and GitHub, researchers can document and share the precise version of the tools that they use, and retrieve specific versions as necessary.

**replicate your environment**  

Containers are standalone, portable environments that contain the entire computing environment used in an analysis: software, all of its dependencies, libraries, binaries, and configuration files, all bundled into one package. Containers can then be archived or shared, allowing them to be used in the future, even as packages, functions, or libraries change over time.

...back to the data

Borrowing an economics term, Leonelli (2015)<sup>1</sup> refers to transferable research data as "fungible objects" defined by "their portability and their prospective usefulness as evidence" (p. 810)<sup>2</sup>
