**reproducible research** <font color=#71A3C3>"is the ability to recompute data analytic results, given an observed data set and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline."<sup>1</sup> 

Replicating studies remains the gold standard for rigorous scientific research, but reproducibility is increasingly viewed as a minimum standard that all scientists should strive toward.<sup>2</sup>

- including the code is important because it documents the decision-making process

**reproducibility for scientific reasons**

given your data, someone else can reproduce your exact results

* increased trustworthiness
* more rigorous, reliable science
* learning more from one another's work

"Science should be 'show me', not 'trust me'; it should be 'help me if you can', not 'catch me if you can'."

*-- Philip B. Stark, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05256-0" target="_blank">Nature 2018</a>*

**reproducibility for personal reasons**

* Did I mention that subjects with IDs > 100 are actually kangaroos and should be excluded?

* How does that patient have 15 months of treatment when we only followed people for 12 months?

* I won the lottery üëè - now my coworker is taking over

* Journal reviews back after 8 months! Time for revisions!
